# Hotplugger: Real USB Port Passthrough for VFIO/QEMU!

Welcome to Hotplugger! This app, as the name might tell you, is a combination of some scripts (python, yaml, udev rules and some QEMU args) to allow you to pass through an actual USB port into a VM. Instead of passing the USB root hub (which could have the side effect of passing *all the ports*, including the ones you didn't want to) or another PCIe hub or something, you can just pass a specific USB port to a VM and have the others free for anything else. Plus, it saves you from using the `vfio-pci` driver for the USB root hub, so you can keep using it for evdev or other things on the VM host.

## Requirements

* `monitor.py` and `hotplugger.py` require **Python 3**
* Only tested with QEMU 5.0.0. Untested with older or newer versions.

## Quick start (Ubuntu 20.10)

1. `git clone https://github.com/darkguy2008/hotplugger.git`

2. (Optional) run `python3 monitor.py` and follow the prompts. Basically once you hit Enter you have to plug and unplug an USB device (a thumbdrive or audio device preferred) into the USB ports that you want to know their `DEVPATH` route from. This will help you identify them so you can write them into `config.yaml` in the `ports` array. This array only accepts `DEVPATH` routes that `UDEV` generates.

3. Edit `config.yaml`. **It must stay in the same folder as `monitor.py` and `hotplugger.py`**. Look at the current example: It's set for a Windows VM (the name doesn't matter, as long as it's unique within the entries of the same file). Make sure the `socket` property matches the file path of the QEMU `chardev` device pointing to an Unix domain socket file and in the `ports` array put the list of the `udev` `DEVPATH` of the USB ports you want to pass through to that VM:

   ```
   virtual_machines:
   
     windows:
       socket: /home/dragon/vm/test/qmp-sock
       ports:
         - /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb3/3-1
         - /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb3/3-2
         - /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb4/4-1
         - /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb4/4-2
   ```

4. Create an `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-zzz-local.rules` file with the following content:

   ```
   SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ACTION=="add", RUN+="/bin/bash -c 'python3 /path-to-hotplugger/hotplugger.py >> /tmp/hotplugger.log' 2>&1"
   SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ACTION=="remove", RUN+="/bin/bash -c 'python3 /path-to-hotplugger/hotplugger.py >> /tmp/hotplugger.log' 2>&1"
   ```

   Make sure to change `path-to-hotplugger` with the path where you cloned the repo to, or installed the package. It can be simplified, but this one is useful in case you want to debug and see what's going on. Otherwise, proceed with a simpler file:

   ```
   SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ACTION=="add", RUN+="/bin/bash -c 'python3 /path-to-hotplugger/hotplugger.py'"
   SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ACTION=="remove", RUN+="/bin/bash -c 'python3 /path-to-hotplugger/hotplugger.py'"
   ```

5. Create the QMP monitor Unix domain socket if you haven't already in your QEMU args. I use this:

   ```
   -chardev socket,id=mon1,server,nowait,path=./qmp-sock
   -mon chardev=mon1,mode=control,pretty=on
   ```

6. Have a coffee! â˜•

## How it works

1. The `udev` rule launches the script on *every* USB event. For each USB `add`/`remove` action there's around 3 to 5+ events. This allows the app to act at any step in the action lifecycle.
2. In the first step it gets the kernel environment variables from `udev` and stores them in a temp file. In those variables, the `DEVPATH`, the `DEVNUM` (host address in QEMU, it seems to change and is sequential...) and the `BUSNUM` (bus address in QEMU) are captured. For the subsequent events, the following steps are run:
   1. It requests QEMU through the Unix socket and the `info usbhost` QMP command the USB info from the host. This gives it an extra field: The host **port** where the device is also connected to. Since I got the `host` and `bus` addresses in the first event, I can use that to parse through the `info usbhost` command's output and find the **port** connected to the device.
   2. If the port is found, using the `device_add` command, a new `usb-host` device is added using the USB `bus` and `port` we got in the previous step, and assigns it a predictable ID that it can use to unplug the device afterwards. To add this of course, the VM should have a `usb-xhci` device I think. Not sure if it's required or not, but I prefer to add it as I have USB 3.0 ports and devices.
   3. The temp file is cleared once the `device_add` command has run successfully.

Steps 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 are run on every `udev` event. For instance, for an audio device it gets 3 or 4 events: One for the HID device, and two or so for the audio devices. My audio device (Corsair Void Elite Wireless) has both stereo audio and a communications device (mono audio, for mic) so for a single dongle like that I get those many events. Since these steps are ran on all the events, there's multiple chances to do the hotplug action. When one of them succeeds, the others will silently fail as QEMU will say that the same device ID is being used, so all is good.

## Troubleshooting

If for some reason the app doesn't seem to work, try these methods:

* Reboot the computer
* Reboot udev: `sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger`
* View udev's logfile: `sudo service udev restart && sudo udevadm control --log-priority=debug && journalctl -f | grep -i hotplugger`
* If you want to see what will be run when you plug a device, try with this command to simulate an udev event: `udevadm test $(udevadm info -a --path=/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb3/3-1/3-1:1.0) --action=add` replacing `--path` with the path of the USB port down to the device itself (in this case, I had a device connected to the `usb3/3-1` port, identified as `3-1:1.0`.
